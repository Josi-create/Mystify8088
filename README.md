CGA Mystify my Life 8088

The classic Windows 95 screensaver "Mystify my life" running on an 8088 machine like the IBM PC 5051.
It runs on CGA machines in 320x200, 4 colour mode.
Tribute to "PCRetroProgrammer" which uses the myline.asm routine, the best and fastest line drawing code for 8088s ever written.

You can run mystify.exe on your 8088 computer. ESC for Quit, Space for Clear Screen

If you want to compile it yourself, you need to install Borland Turbo Assembler and Borland Turbo C on your machine and set the path correctly. Just start compiling by typing "mach.bat".
